# Snake and Ladder Game

This project aims to create a fully functional browser-based Snake and Ladder game in a single HTML file. The game includes a 10x10 game board, two players, dice rolling functionality, player token movement, snake and ladder logic, turn indicator, winner detection, and a reset button.

## Setup

To run the game, simply copy the entire contents of the `index.html` file and paste it into a new HTML file. Open the HTML file in your preferred browser to start playing the game.

## Usage

- Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice and move your player token accordingly.
- The current dice value is displayed prominently on the page either as a large number or as a graphic near the "Roll Dice" button.
- Follow the instructions on the screen to navigate through the game board using the snake and ladder shortcuts.
- The game will indicate whose turn it is and display the winner once the game ends.
- Use the "Reset" button to start a new game.

## Code Explanation

The game is built using inline CSS and JavaScript within the `index.html` file. The JavaScript code controls the game logic, player movement, dice rolling, turn management, snake and ladder effects, and winner detection. The CSS styling ensures the game board layout and player token display.
