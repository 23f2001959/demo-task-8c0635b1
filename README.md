# Snake and Ladder Game

This project is a complete, functional browser-based Snake and Ladder game implemented in a single HTML file. The game includes a 10x10 game board, two players, dice rolls, player token movement, snake and ladder logic, turn indicator, winner detection, and a reset button. The dice value is prominently displayed for easy visibility.

## Usage
- Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice and move your player token.
- Player 1 is represented by a green token, and Player 2 is represented by a blue token.

## Code Explanation
The game logic is implemented using inline CSS and JavaScript within the HTML file. The game board is rendered dynamically using HTML elements, and player movement is controlled through JavaScript functions.
