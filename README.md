# Snake and Ladder Game

## Summary
This project aims to generate a complete, functional browser-based Snake and Ladder game in a single HTML file. The game includes a 10x10 game board, two players, dice rolls, player token movement, snake and ladder logic, turn indicator, winner detection, and a reset button. All CSS and JavaScript code is inline in the HTML file for easy access and usage.

## Setup
Simply copy the content of the `index.html` file and paste it into a new HTML file. Save the file and open it in a web browser to start playing the Snake and Ladder game.

## Usage
- To start the game, click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice and move the player token accordingly.
- The current player's turn is indicated on the screen.
- The dice value is displayed as a large number or graphic near the Roll Dice button.
- Players move along the game board based on the dice roll and encounter snakes or ladders.
- The game continues until a player reaches the last tile and is declared the winner.
- Click the "Reset Game" button to start a new game.

## Code Explanation
The HTML file includes all necessary CSS and JavaScript code inline. The game logic is implemented using JavaScript functions for dice rolling, player movement, snake and ladder effects, turn handling, winner detection, and game reset. CSS styles are used to create the game board layout and design elements. The HTML structure is organized to display the game elements, player tokens, dice visualization, turn indicator, and game board.
