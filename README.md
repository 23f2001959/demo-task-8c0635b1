# Snake and Ladder Game

This project is a complete, functional browser-based Snake and Ladder game implemented in a single HTML file. The game board is rendered as a 10x10 grid, with two player tokens moving according to dice rolls. Snake and ladder logic is implemented, along with turn management and detection of the winner. A reset button is provided for starting a new game.

## Setup

To run the game, you simply need to copy the entire contents of the HTML file and paste it into a new HTML document. Open the file in a browser to play the game.

## Usage

- Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice and move the player token.
- The current player's turn is indicated on the screen.
- The dice value is displayed prominently near the "Roll Dice" button.
- Players move according to the dice roll and encounter snakes and ladders accordingly.
- The game ends when a player reaches the final square. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.

## Code Explanation

The HTML file includes inline CSS styles and JavaScript code for rendering the game board, handling player movements, dice rolls, snake and ladder logic, turn management, and determining the winner. The game logic is implemented using JavaScript functions and event listeners for user interactions.
