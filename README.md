# Snake and Ladder Game

This project is a browser-based Snake and Ladder game implemented in a single HTML file. It includes all necessary CSS and JavaScript inline, without the need for external dependencies. The game board is rendered as a 10x10 grid, with two players taking turns to roll the dice, move their tokens, and try to reach the finish line first.

## Setup

To run this game, simply copy the contents of the HTML file into a new HTML document and open it in a web browser. No additional setup or installation is required.

## Usage

- Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice and move your token.
- The number rolled on the dice is displayed prominently on the page, either as a large number or as a graphic representation.
- Follow the instructions on the game board to climb ladders and avoid snakes.
- The game will indicate whose turn it is and when a player wins.
- Use the "Reset" button to start a new game.

## Code Explanation

The HTML file contains all the necessary markup, including the game board grid, player tokens, dice visualization, and buttons. Inline CSS styles are used for layout and design, while inline JavaScript handles game logic such as dice rolling, player movement, snake and ladder logic, turn tracking, and win detection.
