# Snake and Ladder Game

This project is a demo task to showcase a complete, functional browser-based Snake and Ladder game implemented in a single HTML file. The game includes a 10x10 game board, two players, dice rolls, player token movement, snake and ladder logic, turn indicator, winner detection, and a reset button.

## Setup

Simply copy the provided HTML code and paste it into a new HTML file. The CSS and JavaScript are included inline within the HTML for easy setup and deployment.

## Usage
